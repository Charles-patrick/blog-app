    content: "Yves Saint Laurent (born August 1, 1936, Oran, Algeria—died June 1, 2008, Paris, France) was a French fashion designer noted for his popularization of women’s trousers for all occasions.After completing his secondary education in Oran, Algeria, Saint Laurent left for Paris to pursue a career in designing theatrical costumes and women’s fashions. He attended fashion school for a short time and won first prize in an international design contest. When a Vogue magazine executive showed Christian Dior some of Saint Laurent’s sketches, he was hired immediately as Dior’s assistant. He was 17 years old at the time.As Dior’s protégé, Saint Laurent was named head of the House of Dior after Dior’s sudden death in 1957. Following the “little-girl” look and the A-line silhouette, he introduced more sophisticated, longer skirts and, in 1959, drastically shortened skirts. In 1960 he introduced the chic beatnik look of turtlenecks and black leather jackets edged with fur.",

    title: "Gabrielle Bonheur Chanel: The fashion icon",

    content: "Gabrielle Bonheur Chanel was born in 1883 to Eugénie Jeanne Devolle Chanel, known as Jeanne, a laundrywoman, in the charity hospital run by the Sisters of Providence (a poorhouse) in Saumur, Maine-et-Loire.[9]: 14 [10] She was Jeanne's second child with Albert Chanel; the first, Julia, had been born less than a year earlier. Albert Chanel was an itinerant street vendor who peddled work clothes and undergarments,  living a nomadic life, travelling to and from market towns. The family resided in run-down lodgings. In 1884, he married Jeanne Devolle, persuaded to legitimate his children by her family who had united, effectively, to pay Albert.At birth, Chanel's name was entered into the official registry as Chasnel. Jeanne was too unwell to attend the registration, and Albert was registered as traveling.She went to her grave as Gabrielle Chasnel because to correct, legally, the misspelled name on her birth certificate would reveal that she was born in a poor house hospice. The couple had six children—Julia, Gabrielle, Alphonse (the first boy, born 1885), Antoinette (born 1887), Lucien, and Augustin (who died at six months)[13]—and lived crowded into a one-room lodging in the town of Brive-la-Gaillarde.When Gabrielle was 11 Jeanne died at the age of 32. The children did not attend school.[13] Her father sent his two sons to work as farm labourers and sent his three daughters to the convent of Aubazine, which ran an orphanage. Its religious order, the Congregation of the Sacred Heart of Mary, was founded to care for the poor and rejected, including running homes for abandoned and orphaned girls.It was a stark, frugal life, demanding strict discipline. Placement in the orphanage may have contributed to Chanels future career, as it was where she learned to sew. At age eighteen, Chanel, too old to remain at Aubazine, went to live in a boarding house for Catholic girls in the town of Moulins.",
